\chapter{\xxx{More complicated chapter}}\label{chap:math}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go into to the workings of the engine as a whole.
\item Indepth usage and working of my ECS specifically (as the base and main part).
\item Describe all the clever techniques I used specifically from the Effekt language:
\begin{itemize}
	\item effects
	\item deferred modification
	\item existentials
	\item complex control flow
	\item more
\end{itemize}
\item Compare some specific workings to other engines and how Effekt makes it simpler/more abstract.
\item Elaborate some problems I encountered on the way (including a bit of compiler issues).
\end{enumerate}
