\item[3. Compile] the included \textsf{main.effekt} file with the provided \textsf{build.sh} script for Linux (Mac and Windows should work with the same command written inside the \textsf{build.sh}, but replacing \textsf{effekt.sh} with \textsf{effekt}).
\item[Or change the code] inside the \textsf{main.effekt} (it is configured to run the Snake game, using the engine, by default) and compile it
\item[Or copy] the \verb^game_engine_lib^ folder into your own project and import the required modules with \verb^import game_engine_lib/<module>^, then compile your \textsf{main.effekt}
\item[4. Open] the produced \verb^out/main.html^ file in your HTML5-capable browser
